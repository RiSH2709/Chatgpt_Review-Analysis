- **Sentiment Trends Over Time**: A line chart illustrating how sentiment changes over different time periods based on review dates.

### Net Promoter Score (NPS):
The NPS score, calculated based on user ratings, helps gauge user loyalty and satisfaction. In this project, the NPS was calculated using the assumption that 5-star reviews are **Promoters**, 4-star reviews are **Passives**, and 3-star (or below) reviews are **Detractors**. The final NPS score is approximately **64.35**, indicating a strong likelihood that users would recommend ChatGPT to others.
